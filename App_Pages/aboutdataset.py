The **Diabetes Prediction Dataset** is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative).  
The dataset contains features such as:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Hypertension**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Smoking History**
- **HbA1c Level**
- **Blood Glucose Level**

This dataset can be used to build **machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information.

**Applications:**
1. **Healthcare Professionals** â€“ Identify patients at risk and develop personalized treatment plans.  
2. **Researchers** â€“ Explore relationships between medical/demographic factors and diabetes likelihood.

By leveraging this dataset, we can gain insights into **preventive healthcare** and **early diagnosis** strategies.
